<p align="justify" style="padding:0px 15px 0px 15px;">Based on the video and what i learn so far it realy inspires me to work more hard with web development espeically with Ruby programming. I really appreciate EDA for organizing good programs to allow me and othe friends to have opportunity to get good knowledge, even sometimes i felt that i spent so much time on it. But i'm really happy to do it when i see my progressing for the first week. So for the following week i need to set my schedule for studying this beside i'm at school and work or i won't be able to finish this lesson.</p>

<p align="justify" style="padding:0px 15px 0px 15px;">I'm really excited to participate this kind of learning environment because it can improve my programing skill that before i only the basic. I also want to share what i'm learning from EDA to my friends. Finally i would like to acknowledge EDA again for making this program happen.</p>
