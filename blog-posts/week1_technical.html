<p>I like the user interface of Facebook website. It looks user friendly. Facebook is the new deal! It's a lot more popular than MySpace now, and I think it's the best social networking site right now. 
The second best social networking website in my opinion is Twitter. Facebook helps me a lot with staying in touch with friends I know 
in real life, and that's really beneficial. It helps me a lot with my education as well!</p>
<p>Facebook, like much of the Internet, is a great innovation! It offers you an opportunity to interact with an extraordinarily expansive 
universe of new people. You can sculpt your on-line identity and learn more about how the Internet and its various programs work to 
create new relationships and communities. For the entrepreneurially minded, it might be an introduction into business as you think of 
how to "market" yourself. Individuals with particular social identities or hobbies, say as a Christian gay person or someone who likes 
a narrow range of military on-line games, can use it to find friends with common interests. Facebook is a cool tool.</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>Google is an American multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include online 
advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and software.</p>
<p>I always use google everyday when i'm online. Goolle search engine is so helpful. We can search what we want to know with the keyword, 
then google will show the list of result.</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>YouTube is a video-sharing website, created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005 and owned by Google since late 2006, 
on which users can upload, view and share videos.</p>
<p>Youtube store lots of video uploaded by users from everywhere. We can look for music, movie, video tuturial...</p>
