<h1><center>Thinking Style</center></h1>
<p>It's common knowledge that each of us learns differently, but different "thinking styles" are actually much more sophisticated and specific concepts, researched and reviewed by learning experts.</p>
<p>No particular thinking style is "better" than another, and most people have a mix of a few different learning styles.</p>

<p>There are four types of thinking style:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Concrete</strong>: This quality enables you to register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts. "<strong>It is what it is.</strong>"</li>
  <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: This quality allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond "what is" to the more subtle implications. "<strong>It is not always what it seems.</strong>"</li>
<li><strong>Sequential</strong>: Allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner. When using your sequential ability, you are following a logical train of thought, a traditional approach to dealing with information. You may also prefer to have a plan and to follow it, rather than relying on impulse.</li>  
<li><strong>Random</strong>: Lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.</li>
  </ul>
